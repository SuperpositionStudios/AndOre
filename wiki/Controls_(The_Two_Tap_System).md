# Controls in And/Ore work on what we call "The Double-Tap System." 

The Two-Tap System involves pressing a "mode" key which determines which mode you are in, and then a modifier key to change the exact actions. The various modes and their mode keys are: 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Key</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Movement</td>
        <td>M</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Build</td>
        <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Loot</td>
        <td>L</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Increase Corp Standing</td>

The modifier key is a number and will allow for you to switch between certain actions within a mode, for example, building a different building or using a different potion. The modes that allow for modifier keys are Loot, Build, and Use Item from Inventory. Using a modifier key in a mode that does not require a modifier key, will all have the same result. 

After selecting a mode and a modifier key, you must press W, A, S, or D to activate it. You must press the key relative to the direction you wish to use the action.

In Build mode, each modifier key allows you to build a different building.  
* (B1) is used to build a Fence.  
* (B2) is used to build a Hospital.  
* (B3) is used to build an Ore Generator.  
* (B4) is used to build a Pharmacy.  
* (B5) is used to build a Door.  
* (B6) is used to build a Corp Respawn Point.  
* (B7) is used to build a Turret.  
* (B8) is used to build a Spike Trap.

In Loot mode, each modifier key allows you to purchase a different potion from the pharmacy.
* (L1) is used to buy a Health Potion.
* (L2) is used to buy a Health Cap Potion.
* (L3) is used to buy an Attack Boost Potion.
* (L4) is used to buy a Mining Multiplier Potion. (Currently Disabled)

In Use from Inventory mode, each modifier key lets you use the potion in the slot that the modifier key equals.
